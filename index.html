        <p>
            Why is it that desire works in such counterintuitive ways? I’m sure
          you’ve heard the adage “we want things we can’t have.” And because we
          have stupid brains, "we don’t always want what we think we want." I’ve
          found, however, that there’s another more concrete type of desire. A
          more complicated one that can grow over time - through comfort, shared
          experiences, and by building something special together. This second
          kind is for sure less fun to daydream about, but in many ways can be
          more profound. And while it’s less sexy on the surface, still waters
          run deep.

            There are a lot of people I’ve met, either as friends or potential
          romantic partners, where I would start to love them for some
          particular quality about them. “Oh, I like this person because they’re
          smart or funny, because they have good taste, because they know all
          the best restaurants,” whatever.
        </p>

        <p>
            There’s another kind of love that’s much rarer, where I begin to love
          someone because of who they are, not any particular thing. It’s as if
          at a certain point I don’t have a choice in the matter. I just love,
          without deciding. My family, best friends, my cat - they all fall into
          this category. And of course, I've had that same love for you since I first
          met you in that dumb Econ class with that curly-haired professor.

            I assume by now you know where this letter is going, but when it comes
          down to it Maïa, this isn’t some teenage crush I have that is boiling
          over. In all earnsty, I believe that if our lives ever aligned and we
          had the chance to build something more than a friendship, it’d be
          special by nature.

            I’m telling you this now, at a pretty inopportune time for myself
          probably, not to settle matters indefinitely or to act on anything in the moment (our circumstances don’t really permit that,) but just to be honest
          with you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our lives present us with a lot of “what ifs?” that we never get the
          answers to, and that’s perfectly alright, but when I think about these
          particular “what ifs?” - well those we can find an answer to if we want.
          And I have the feeling the answer would be something uniquely
          wonderful.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m also deciding to bring this up now because sooner than later those questions won’t be
          answerable. I don’t want to have a family and a little burger-eating
          kid and have you asking “what if?” just a few years later than I did.
        </p>  

        <p>
            I’m not sure what you’ll do with this knowledge, and in all honesty,
          I’m not sure what to do with it either. I'd like to know if you’ve
          thought about those same questions at some point. Or even if you’re
          curious about the answers. If you are, it might still be the case that in the current moment, it's better to not do anything, but we
          should at least talk about it. If not, we can let sleeping dogs lie.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of the day, I have much love to give Maïa. You’ll get a lot
          of it in whatever form our relationship takes! Always know that.
        </p>

        <p>Peace, and Love</p>
